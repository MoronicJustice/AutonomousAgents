In Tilibng Engine, they have some TileSprite slots to fill. they can drag and drop their own defined TileSprites into these slots, but they need to
make define some prefabs for these TileSprites themselves. For example, I have prefabs for each location, they consist of an empty GameObject with
the TileSprite script as a component. Within that prefab, they have to define the attributes for the specific TileSprite.
